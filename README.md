# rockpaperscissors
A basic game of rock paper scissors for Project Odin, where I'm using the programming concepts I have learned so far, including:
- Functions
- Variables
- For loops
- If statements
- Problem solving techniques

For the first part of this project, the game is played using the browser console. A GUI will be added in a later version.
